         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So fareth it with me a poore Labourer in the Lords Vineyard, I acknowledge my own wants, that I am not able to bring any great and glorious offering: yet I haue brought here a ſmall preſent, as it were, a little Goates hayre, or (as with the widdow) two Mites to bee caſt into the Treaſury of God. It is the old and ancient doctrine of faith and repentance that I heere entreat of, a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subiect, eſpecially in theſe dangerous dayes, wherein men labour more for the ſhewes of godlines, then for the power of it: for we need not ſo much to complain of ignorance in this age (for many haue knowledge) as the want of ſincerity. I haue endevoured in this ſhort <hi>Expoſition</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2570:5"/> to ſet out the nature of true repentance, which onely is to bee found in the godly, being ſound and ſincere: as alſo the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical repentance of the wicked, which is but for a time, not durable, nor laſting. If my lines be plaine, they beſt anſwere a ſtraight and an euen leuell. The euidence of the ſpirit is beſt ſeene in plaineſſe. And now this poore labour of mine flyes to your Lordſhip for protection, not fearing your iudgement in the allowance, or doubting of your fauour in the acceptance thereof: for matters of learning, are moſt fitte to bee preſented to thoſe that excell therein; for, as the Prouerbe is, <hi>Scientia neminem habet inimicum, praeter ignorantem,</hi> ſo by the ſame rule, may I ſay, <hi>Scientia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem habet amicum &amp; Mecaenatem, niſi ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioſum fautoremque bonarum literarum.</hi> And although (Right Reuerend) I know right well, that you not onely fauour Religion, but are an earneſt profeſſor thereof, and that I need not exhort and ſtirre you vp therein; yet let mee in moſt humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſire you, that as you haue done much good ſince you came into this place, ſo

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the motion and godly perſwaſion which the children of God make one to another; <hi>Come let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the reaſons and arguments which they vſe to enforce their godly exhortation to perſwade each other to turne vnto the Lord; and they bee two eſpecially: The firſt, drawn from the iuſtice of God in theſe two words; <hi>Hee hath spoyled, hee hath wounded.</hi> The other, drawne from the mercy of God in theſe words; <hi>Hee will heale vs, hee will bind vs vp.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this argument taken from the mercy of God, is a reaſon of all reaſons, and ſuch an argument as <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:2570:12"/> makes choyſe of aboue all others, ſaying; <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, that yee giue vp your bodies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.5.</note> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay; If the manifold mercies of God, both for ſoule and body; if the bloudſhed of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt will not moue a man to turne vnto God, he is in a wofull caſe. I ſay, becauſe this argument is of ſpeciall force to moue hard-hearted ſinners to turne vnto God. The people of God in this place vrge it further, and amplifie this argument by two other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.

The other circumſtance is taken from the greatneſſe of Gods mercy, <hi>Hee will reuiue vs, Hee will rayſe vs vp:</hi> anſwerable to the two former words: <hi>He hath ſpoyled vs, he hath wounded vs:</hi> So here the mercy of God exceedes his iuſtice: for it is not ſayde, that hee had kilde vs, or caſt vs away, but onely ſpoyled vs, and wounded vs with a blow, or ſtripe, or twaine: But his mercy is aboue all his workes: for though he had vtterly killed vs, yet he will reuiue vs; Nay, hee will rayſe vs vp, though wee had layne not foure dayes, but foure hundred dayes in the graue of ſinne; yet his mercifull right hand can and will rayſe vs vp againe.</p>
               <p>The third ſpeciall thing in theſe verſes, is the fruits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of repentance, and of true conuerſion: If we doe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent, and draw neere vnto God by Conuerſion: The firſt fruit of our Repentance is this; That as wee draw neere vnto God by true and vnfained Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſo he will draw neere vnto vs, and <hi>Wee ſhall liue in his ſight;</hi> that is, in his fauour, and in the light of his countenance: Nay, wee that are truely conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall liue and behaue our ſelues as euer in Gods preſence, and before his bleſſed face.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:2570:13"/>
               <p>The ſecond fruit of our true Conuerſion and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance is,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.3.</note> 
                  <hi>That wee ſhall haue knowledge.</hi> The Lord will in mercy poure into our hearts, the true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge of himſelfe, euen the knowledge of the whole Trinity, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt: Nay, wee ſhall not onely haue this heauenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge poured into our hearts by the Spirite of Ieſus Chriſt; but as a man in a dropſie, the more hee drinkes, the more he thirſts, and deſires drinke: ſo <hi>Wee ſhall indeuour our ſelues to know the Lord:</hi> That is, wee ſhall hunger and thirſt after this heauenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as the food of our ſoules, and neuer to be glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, but labour to abound more and more in it.</p>
               <p>The third fruit of our Conuerſion, is in the third verſe; That as wee doe by true and vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance draw neare vnto our God: So will he be moſt ready to helpe and to comfort vs. <hi>The Lords comming foorth, is prepared as the morning:</hi> True it is, that the ſenſe and feeling of Gods mercy, is oftentimes extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the hearts of his children, as the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table light and beames of the Sunne vnder a thicke cloud, or when it is gone vnder the earth: So, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes wee thinke that God forgets vs, and hides himſelfe from vs: But his comming to helpe vs is <hi>Prepared,</hi> and therefore moſt certaine: and he ſhall come as the <hi>Morning,</hi> moſt comfortably vnto vs. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the bright beames and cleare countenance and face of the Sunne, after a windy, tempeſtuous, ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and boyſterous night, is very comfortable: So the bright beames of Gods mercies, breaking foorth, and ſhining vpon our hearts after a darke and cloudy night of affliction, it is moſt comfortable to glad and reioyce the diſtreſſed Soule of a poore ſinner.</p>
               <p>Nay, in the ſecond ſimilitude hee ſhewes, that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2570:13"/> comming of the Lord, ſhall bee not onely ioyfull and very comfortable, but moſt effectuall to a wounded Soule that lyes languiſhing vnder the heate of Gods wrath; that as helpe long looked for, and in time of greateſt danger, is of al other moſt welcome: ſo, when the Lord ſhall come with helpe and deliuerance, after great danger, and long expected, this is moſt ſet by, and moſt eſteemed: And therefore the Prophet ſayeth; <hi>The Lord will come as the raine, euen as the latter raine vnto the earth.</hi> Now, as moderate raine is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at all times, ſo eſpecially in the heate of ſummer, after a great and a long drought, when the earth is ſcorched with the heate of the Sunne, and begins to capper and gape for want of moiſture: ſo then a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious raine, a ſweet ſhower is moſt welcome; then it doth moſt good, not onely to cheriſh the thirſtie and ſcorched earth, but alſo to ripen the fruites of the field, and to bring them to perfection: Euen ſo, when a poore Soule doth pant and breath vnder the burthen of his ſinnes, and is ſcorched with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heate of affliction: then if the Lord in mercie ſend a gracious ſtorme and comfortable raine into our thirſty ſoules, and ſend a heauenly ſhower of his bleſſed mercy; Nay, if he diſtill but one little droppe of his mercy in the burning heate of affliction, this is moſt welcome, this is moſt comfortable to aſſwage, and to comfort the heate of a ſinner, ſcorched and tormented for feare of the burning anger and wrath of God againſt ſinne.</p>

Indeed, moſt men little regarde this, they cannot be perſwaded that they bee bound to ſaue the ſoules of their brethren, and therefore they ſay, euery man for himſelfe, and God for vs all: but the truth is, that when euery man ſeeks himſelfe, the Deuill gets all. To ſaue ſoules, to draw men to Chriſt: Oh, wee thinke this is the Miniſters duety, it belongs to him alone, it belongs not to vs. True it is, that it belongs eſpeciall to the Miniſter to labour to ſaue mens ſoules; and therefore they are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially bound to labour by continuall teaching and preaching of the word of God; as alſo by their godlie life, to draw men to God, to exhort them, to call vpon them to turne vnto the Lord: and if they bee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and careleſſe, the flocke of Chriſt muſt needs go to ruine: yet many there are that feed themſelues to the full, but regard not to feed the flocke, ouer which the holy Ghoſt hath made them Ouerſeers. Theſe are they that liue of the Altar, but care not to miniſter at the Altar: They will bee ſure to reape carnall things, but they haue no conſcience to ſow ſpirituall things.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2570:19"/> God thy ſelfe, nor helpe them forward that would.</p>
                  <p>Well, as it is the duty of the Miniſter; eſpecially, in publike: ſo it is the duety of euery Chriſtian man in priuate, to bring others to God. Art thou an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, thou haſt the charge of the ſoule of thy wife: art thou a father, thou ſhalt anſwere for the ſoule of thy child: art thou a maſter, well, looke to draw thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants vnto God.

                     <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Father, heere am I, and the children which thou haſt giuen mee,</hi> Oh, what a comfort is it to a chriſtian ſoule, to a godly man, or a chriſtian woman, when they can ſay, O Lord, heere am I, and heere bee my wife, my children, and my ſeruants, which thou haſt giuen me. You are carefull to prouide for your wiues, meate, drinke, and apparrell; and for your children, lands, and liuings; and haue you not care of their poore ſoules, but let them periſh for want of inſtruction?</p>
                  <p>But ſuch is the negligence and grieuous careleſnes of Maſters and Parents in this miſerable and curſed age of the world, that it were better to bee ſome mens ſheepe then their ſonnes, and their horſes then their ſeruants; for no man is ſo careleſſe, but hee will pittie his horſe, and looke to his ſheepe: but as for their ſonnes or ſeruants, they may ſinke or ſwimme, they care not for them: Well, thy wife may periſh in her ſinnes, thy ſonne may periſh in his ignorance, and thy ſeruant for want of thy inſtruction; but the Lord will require their bloud at thy hands. Nay, wee may ſee in this preſent example, that it is not onely the duety of the Miniſter, and thoſe which bee Maſters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to ſeeke to draw thoſe that are vnder them to God; but the ſame is the duety of euery Chriſtian man and woman; it is that which belongs vnto all men, to call on others to draw them to God: Nay, if

And howſoeuer many can make blinde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for their owne euill life: ſurely, the beginning of all euill is this, to turne away from God.

                     <hi>Hee tooke his iourney into a farre Country:</hi> farre away, and yet hee thought not himſelfe farre inough from his Father: but who willed him to depart, was hee put out of his Fathers houſe? Surely, no; but he himſelfe of his own accord would needes bee gone. Euen ſo, doth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner make a voluntary ſeparation betwixt God and his ſoule. God doth neuer forſake till hee bee forſaken. Now a ſinner is ſayde to depart from God in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Firſt, by an oppoſite and far different diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, Gods <hi>volo</hi> being mans <hi>nolo,</hi> Gods <hi>will</hi> being mans <hi>nill:</hi> by omitting that which hee ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and by committing that which hee ſhould omit: As when wee ſee two ſitting and talking together, and the one varieth from the other in opinion, we ſay, the one is farre from the other: and in the ſame reſpect, is a ſinner ſaid to goe farre from God. Secondly, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſaid to goe far from God, in regard of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the multitude of his ſinnes that he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which the more they are, the farther they leade a ſinner: for euery ſinne being a departure from God, a ſinner may rightly bee ſaid to depart leſſer or farther, according to the number &amp; quality of the ſins they commit: Some, being the ſinnes of infirmity, ſome of ignorance, ſome of malice, and ſome of preſumption;

I haue knowne many, that while they haue beene vnder the Miniſtery of the Word, haue beene touched with ſorrow for their ſinnes, their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being conuinced, and for the time preſent they haue purpoſed to forſake them.<note place="margin">Act. 26.28.</note> So that as <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſayde to <hi>Paul, Thou haſt almoſt perſwaded me to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:</hi> So, they haue almoſt beene perſwaded to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe: but alas, how ſodainely it hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, it may appeare by their falling into the ſame ſinne againe; for, ſo ſoone as they haue beene out of the Church, they remember it no more, but returne to their former courſes; <hi>As the dogge to the vomite.</hi>

And herein they deale with the Lord, as the people of Iſrael did, who,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.33.</note> when God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2570:30"/> brought any iudgement or calamity vpon them, then preſently they returned, and ſought God earely; but when the iudgement of God was remoued, they ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſide like a broken bow.

Oh then, let vs not deferre the time of our repentance, but ſo ſoone as euer we heare our ſinnes reproued, and the iudgements of God threatned againſt them, that our conſciences are conuinced: Oh let vs then with ſpeed addreſſe our ſelues to performe it.

Well, this is the folly, or rather extreame madnes of many a poore ſoule, who, though they know how to aſſwage the anger of God that is kindled againſt them for their ſinnes; yet deferre the ſame, and put it off from time to time. And herein the Deuill deales with men like a racking Vſurer, who is wont to giue day after day of payment vnto a man, vntill at laſt hee winde his inheritance into his hand: Euen ſo doth the Deuill deale with ſinners, hee doth harden them on ſtill from day to day in their ſinnes, vntill at the laſt hee hath gotten them into his owne inheritance, and made them partakers of eternall darkeneſſe with himſelfe for euer.

Firſt, a moſt godly and chriſtian exhortation of the beleeuing Iewes, wherein they perſwade each other mutually to <hi>Returne vnto the Lord.</hi> Secondly, the reaſons that they vſe the better to moue and induce one another to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duty of Repentance, the firſt drawn from the iuſtice of God in theſe words, <hi>He hath wounded vs, Hee hath ſpoyled vs:</hi> The ſecond, drawn from his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>Hee will beale vs, hee will bind vs vp.</hi> And becauſe this reaſon drawne from the mercy of God is a reaſon of all reaſons, yea, a moſt ſpeciall reaſon to moue any one to <hi>turne to God</hi> that hath any ſparke of grace; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2570:48"/> the the holy Ghoſt doth amplifie this reaſon by two other circumſtances; the firſt, drawn from the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the time, wherein the Lord afflicts his people; it is but for a day or twaine, or at the moſt for three dayes, a ſhort time, the Lord will not alwayes be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his children, but howſoeuer, he ſhall chaſtice them for a time, it will bee but for a time, <hi>Heauineſſe may indure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond, taken from the greatneſſe of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, that though he hath <hi>spoyled</hi> vs, yet hee will <hi>Reuiue vs,</hi> and though hee had grieuouſly wounded vs, yet he will bind vp all the bleeding wounds of our ſoules, if we will patiently abide his leaſure.</p>
               <p>The third ſpeciall point, is the fruit of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which are three: The firſt is, that if wee haue once beene ſpoyled of our owne righteouſneſſe, and wounded truely for our ſinnes, and beene <hi>healed,</hi> and wrapped vp by the mercifull hand of God, <hi>We ſhall then liue as in his preſence,</hi> in all holines and righteouſnes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he will power into our hearts that knowledge which will bring vs vnto eternall life, to know his will, how hee is affected towards vs: and this <hi>knowledge</hi> ſhal direct vs to walke wiſely before his face, ſo that we ſhal deſire to grow in this knowledge, and ſtudy dayly to attaine to a greater meaſure of it: <hi>We ſhall endeuour our ſelues to know the Lord.</hi> And the third and laſt fruit of Repentance is, that if we will draw neare to God by true repentance, hee will draw neare to vs, to comfort vs; ſet out by two ſimilitudes, the firſt of them is in theſe words: <hi>The Lords comming is prepared as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> for indeed, many times it comes to paſſe in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>3</label> hearts of Gods children, that the ſenſe and feeling of Gods loue and fauour is oftentimes extinguiſhed: as the comfortable heate and light of the Sunne is taken away by reaſon of ſome thicke cloud that doth paſſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2570:49"/> betwixt the Sunne and the earth; ſo, many times we thinke that God forgets vs, &amp; hides himſelfe from vs: but his comming to helpe vs is <hi>prepared,</hi> and therefore moſt certaine. <hi>And he ſhall come as the morning,</hi> and therefore moſt comfortable: for as the bright beams and cleare countenance of the Sunne after a windy &amp; boiſterous night, is very comfortable: Euen ſo, when after a cloudy night of affliction, wherein wee haue beene <hi>wounded and broken</hi> in our ſoules for our ſinnes: the bright beams of Gods mercy breaking then forth, ſhall bee moſt comfortable to glad and reioyce the ſoule of a poore ſinner: This then is the firſt fruit that ſhall follow our true conuerſion vnto God, <hi>The Lords going foorth</hi> (to comfort vs, and to deliuer vs) <hi>is prepared,</hi> the Lord hath purpoſed it, and determined it of folde, that thoſe that repent and <hi>Returne</hi> vnto him, ſhal find comfort and refreſhing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſimilitude which ſheweth the ſecond fruit of repentance, ſheweth that the Lords comming ſhal not onely bee comfortable, but alſo moſt effectuall, and moſt welcome vnto the ſoule of this ſame poore ſinner, that as helpe and deliuerance in time of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trſt danger is moſt welcome: So, when the Lord ſhall come with great and effectuall comfort, and bring helpe and deliuerance in time of greateſt affliction &amp; danger. Oh then it will be moſt ſet by and eſteemed, and to aſſure the poore child of God of this comfort in time of need, the Prophet ſaith, that the Lord will come as the <hi>Raine, euen as the latter raine vnto the earth:</hi> Now as moderate raine is welcome as at all times, ſo eſpecially in the heate of ſummer after a great and a long drought, when the earth is ſcorched with the heat of the Sunne, and beginnes to capper and gape for want of moiſture, then a gracious and ſweet ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is moſt welcome: Euen ſo, when a poore ſoule doth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2570:49"/> pant and breath vnder the burthen of his ſinnes, and is ſchorched with the burning heat of affliction: then if the Lord in mercy ſend a gracious raine, an heauenly ſhower of his bleſſed mercy in this heat of affliction, this would bee moſt welcome, this would bee moſt comfortable; and this doth the Lord promiſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Church and children if they will <hi>Returne vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the exhortation wee haue ſpoke of before, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of their reaſons; the firſt, drawne from his iuſtice, <hi>Hee hath wounded vs, hee hath ſpoyled vs.</hi> And the ſecond, drawne from his mercy, <hi>Hee will heale vs, hee will bind vs vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe this reaſon or argument drawn from the meccy of God, is the chiefeſt of all other, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth when he ſayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>I beſeech you brethren by the mercies of God:</hi> therefore the holy Ghoſt here ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies this reaſon: firſt by the ſhortneſſe of time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord afflicts his people, it is but for a day or two, a very ſhort moment, <hi>After two dayes,</hi> or at the moſt, <hi>in the third day,</hi> hee will come vnto vs, if we humble our ſelues vnder his mighty hand,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After two dayes.</hi> It is all one as if they ſhould haue ſaid, True it is, the Lord hath grieuouſly <hi>ſpoyled</hi> vs for our ſinnes, and <hi>wounded</hi> vs for our iniquities, ſo as his hand ſeemes grievous vnto vs: yea, let vs breake off our ſinnes by repentance, and let vs <hi>Returne againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him</hi> from whom we haue departed by our ſinnes, and the Lord will ſoon remoue his iudgements from vs.</p>
               <p>In this verſe note three things: firſt, the perſon from whom all helpe, comfort and deliuerance doth come, <hi>He.</hi>

And yet notwithſtanding, God heares his children in their miſeries, and forſakes them not, but in two dayes, or at the moſt in three dayes, that is, in a very ſhort time, ſends them comfort; though hee take not their afflictions away, yet he giues them that which is better for them. Our Sauiour Chriſt prayed vnto his Father moſt earneſtly with cries and teares, to be freed from death,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note>

               <p>And ſo it is with the poore members of Chriſt, they be afflicted, they liue in ſorrow, in pouerty, in ſickneſſe, in griefe of mind: Well, the Lord he giues them patience to ſuffer this affliction, ſo as it is not tedious and grieuous vnto them, and by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all afflicting of them he humbles them, and purges them of their cankered corruption, and ſtirres vp in them the feruency of prayer, makes them out of loue with the world, and makes them more to hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his mercy, and to depend on his fatherly goodnes.

                  <p>Well, you heare that ignorance is a great ſinne, eſpecially, wilfull ignorance.

                  <p>Thus hauing ſhewed the ſin it ſelfe, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the Nature of the ſame, that it is oppoſite to knowledge, wee will proceed a little further, and ſhew the cauſes, why this fearefull iudgement of God raignes in moſt places, and why people are ſo ignorant. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the remedy of this ſinne, how people may get out of it, and ſo come to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, and <hi>Eternall life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The mayne cauſe why people bee ſo ignorant as they bee,<note place="margin">Cauſes of ignorance.</note> is the want of teaching in moſt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, howſoeuer it hath pleaſed God that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint cannot bee taken vp of this Country, &amp; parts:<note place="margin">1 Want of Preaching</note> yet I am not ignorant, that in ſome Townes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes they haue the Word very ſeldome preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, perhaps monthly, or leſſe: Now,<note place="margin">Pro. 29.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Where the Word is not preached, there the people periſh;</hi> or where viſion failes, the people are naked, void of knowledge,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> grace, or the feare of God: <hi>How ſhall they beleeue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Preacher?</hi> ſo, how ſhould they know God,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.14.

And how can
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2570:82"/> it bee otherwiſe: And therefore in the three firſt Chapters of the Revelation, where the Holy Ghoſt commends or diſcommends the Miniſter; he doth likewiſe commend or diſcommend the people, for the good eſtate of the people, depends (for the moſt part) on the good paines of the Miniſter.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 Careleſnes of the people.</note>Another cauſe why ignorance abounds, is the wonderfull ſecurity and careleſneſſe of the people, they haue no deſire to know God, nor loue, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to the ſincere Milke of the Word: yea, they are well content to liue ſtill in their damnable ignorance and blindneſſe:<note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>Euery man by Nature is a beaſt by his owne knowledge:</hi> Man by Nature hath no more knowledge of God, then a beaſt; When <hi>Adam</hi> fell, hee loſt that excellent knowledge of God, and now by Nature wee are blind &amp; ignorant, without the true knowledge of God in Ieſus Chriſt, till the Lord doe enlighten vs, and open our eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt vnto vs in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his Word, the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs come to the remedies: Ignorance
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2570:82"/> of Gods word is a great ſinne,<note place="margin">Remedies of Ignorance.</note> and a fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon any people; for, they can neuer come to faith, repentance, obedience, and etetnall life ſo long as they liue in it; no, they muſt needs liue in all ſin againſt God and man.</p>
                  <p>Well,<note place="margin">1 To ſee our ignorance, and to repent of the ſame.</note> would you know how to get out of your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and ſo from vnder this fearefull and heauy iudgement of God that lies ſo heauy vpon you? would you come to <hi>knowledge</hi> to know God the Father, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, which is the onely way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life? You muſt then repent of your ignorance,<note place="margin">Io. 17.3. Act. 17.20.</note> you muſt carefully ſee it, and acknowledge it that you bee extreame ignorant in Gods matters, blind in Gods word, without the true Knowledge of God in Ieſus Chriſt; you muſt ſee it and confeſſe it, and withall bee ſorry for it, and bewayle your eſtate that you haue liued ſo long in ignorance; and withall, you muſt deſire the pardon of the ſame at Gods hands, and labour to come to knowledge in time to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you would get out of your wofull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and come to true knowledge,<note place="margin">2 Attend vpon the miniſtery of the Word preached. 1. Pet. 2.2. Rom. 1.21. &amp; 10.14. 1. Cor. 1.21. Act. 2.37.</note> you muſt then carefully vſe all holy meanes to come thereto. Firſt, aboue all the reſt, you muſt hunger and thirſt after the Word of God, the preaching of the Word: Frequent Sermons, and tread in Gods houſe where wiſdome cryes vnto you, and vtters her voyce. The preaching of the Word of God is the moſt excellent meanes to bring men out of the gulfe of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to ſauing knowledge, true faith, and eternall life.</p>
                  <p>A third meanes to get out of ignorance, and to attaine vnto this ſauing <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 To reade the Scriptures.</note> is the diligent &amp; carefull reading of the holy Scriptures, the olde and new Teſtament, according to that of our Sauiour,

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4 The reading &amp; hearing of godly Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes.</note>A fourth meanes to get out of ignorance, and to attaine to this ſauing <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is the reading &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Catechiſmes, which containe the ſumme of Chriſtian Religion: It is a ſpeciall means to bring men to knowledge; and howſoeuer men thinke baſe of this kind of teaching; yet it is exceeding profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary, and a ſpeciall means to bring men to knowledge; and as for thoſe that vnderſtand not the Principles of Religion, certainely, their caſe is dangerous; for Faith is not without the knowledge of theſe Principles in ſome meaſure, of the Law, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Faith, Sacraments, Prayer, the Trinity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſpeciall means to get out of ignorance, and to attaine to true and ſauing <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">5. Care to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe that wee know.</note> is for a man to frame his life according to the Word of God, to leade a holy, a Chriſtian, and a godly life; that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his knowledge is not great, yet his care and deſire to walke with God,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.47.</note> to lead a holy and ſanctified life, &amp; to liue according to his knowledge, this pleaſeth the Lord well:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.6.</note> for I doubt not but little knowledge when the ſame is found in Chriſtian obedience, is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> &amp; more acceptable with God, then much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge when obedience is wanting.</p>
                  <p>Well, to conclude this point, the vſe of this Doctrine concernes both Miniſter and people.</p>

If a man ſhould put his child to Nurſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two or three yeares ſhould find his child nothing grown, hee would ſurely bee grieued. Alas, if we ſhall after many yeares preaching grow nothing in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is a manifeſt ſigne that wee are indeed but ſtaruelings: and therefore let vs euery one in the feare of God, labour to <hi>Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſeeing the food of our ſoules, and the meanes whereby wee muſt grow, is the preaching of the Word; Let vs hunger and thirſt after it, let vs ſeeke for it, for if that be wanting, it is impoſſible we ſhould grow in knowledge, or in any grace of God to eternal life.</p>
                  <trailer>And thus much for the third fruit or effect of true Repentance; namely, a hungring after more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a dayly growth and proceeding in the ſame. It followeth.</trailer>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe that though the Lord doe ſeeme to forget his people for a time, and deferre his helpe; yet in his good time hee will come with abundance of comfort, and cauſe the bright beams of his fauour and the cleare Sunne-ſhine of his mercy,<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> to ſhine into our diſtreſſed ſoules. If a man were in a waſte wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a darke and ſolemne night, and ſee neyther Sunne, Moone nor Starre, but heare the fearefull and terrible roaring and velling of wilde beaſts: Oh how glad would this man be, after a dangerous, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous, ſtormy and ſolemne night, to ſee the face of the Sunne, and the comfortable dawning of the day: Euen ſo, what can bee more comfortable to a poore diſtreſſed Soule, and a wounded conſcience, after many blacke and ſtormy nights of affliction, when the conſcience of a poore ſinner is vpon the Racke, and when a poore Soule ſhall ſee the anger of God againſt ſinne, ſee the torment of Hell, and his owne

                  <p>Secondly, it pleaſeth the Lord to compare his helpe to the riſing of the Sunne, becauſe as nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> can hinder that from riſing, but it keepeth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that courſe which God hath ſet it: Euen ſo the Lord he hath <hi>prepared</hi> the helpe of his people, and the Deuill, nay all the Deuils in Hell cannot hinder him, no more then wee can by all our skill and might, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the riſing of the Sunne.

                  <p>Thirdly, as the morning doth not diffuſe and ſpread his light ouer the earth all at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by little and little, as the Sunne growes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and higher: Euen ſo, the Lord for the moſt part makes his loue and his mercy known vnto men, not all at once, but by degrees, by little and little, as it ſeemes beſt to his Maieſty, and for the comfort of his children.</p>

                  <p>Seeing the Lord is <hi>Prepared</hi> to helpe vs, and that with abundance of comfort, and ſo as no Creature, no, not the gates of Hell cannot hinder him, but he will make his loue knowne vnto vs: Wee muſt all learne to poſſeſſe our ſoules with patience, to awayte the Lords leaſure for our deliuerance; not to preſcribe vnto him the manner or the time when wee would be deliuered.

                  <p>In this people here we may behold the nature and <label type="milestone">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2570:107"/> to the Temple, ſeemed to repent; yet it was onely in outward ſhew, not ſound nor ſincere, it neuer came from their hearts. And what account ſuch ſeruice of God is with God, hee declares by his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> when hee ſayth,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1.14.</note> 
                     <hi>My ſoule hateth your New Moones, and your appointed Feaſts: They are a burden vnto mee, I am a weary to beare them.</hi> They would keepe the Sabbaths, and frequent the ſolemne aſſemblies, but it was but for cuſtome and for faſhion ſake: they would learne nothing at al; though their bodies were there, yet their hearts were not there.

                     <hi>This people come neare vnto mee with their mouth, and honour mee with their lips, but their hearts are far from mee.</hi> He blameth them, not for that they came not into Gods Temple, and into the Aſſembly of Gods people; for, herein they were very forward; but that they brought now a lame Sacrifice vnto the Lord, it was but a lippe ſeruice, and a Will worſhippe, and the Lord doth eſteeme no better of it then the killing of a man, and the cutting off of a dogges necke, or the offering vp of Swines bloud; all which are abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the Lord: for God is a ſpirit, and therefore will bee worſhipped,<note place="margin">Eſay. 66.3.4</note> not onely according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremony of his worſhippe, but in ſpirit &amp; truth: <hi>To whom will I haue respect vnto, but to him that is poore, &amp; of a contrite ſpirit,</hi>

And ſurely, this is the onely reaſon, as I take, why men profit no more vnder the Preaching of the Word, in this time of the Goſpell; namely this, becauſe men perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that ſo long as they performe the outward rites of Gods worſhippe &amp; ſeruice, as to come to Church,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2570:107"/> heare the Word, receiue the Sacrament and the like, all is well with them, they need no more.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Iewes wee may clearely ſee a counterpane of our people and time. What is the cauſe, why after <label type="milestone">

Why did not the meanes that conuerted thoſe Iewes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter, conuert theſe of whom the Lord ſpeaketh in this place? Surely, the Prophet giues a reaſon of it in this verſe; namely, becauſe theſe Iewes thought that they had goodneſſe inough, and religion inough, ſo long as they performed the outward part of Gods worſhippe and ſeruice, and for this very cauſe, all theſe meanes could doe them no good.</p>
                  <p>And is not this the ſinne of our times and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?<note place="margin">Note.</note> doe not moſt men content themſelues with the outward ſeruice and worſhippe of God, to come to Church to heare the Word, &amp; receiue the Sacrament? and thinke then they haue honoured God highly, and ſerued him aſwell as the beſt of them all, and that God can require no more at their hands: I appeale vnto your hearts and conſciences whether this be not ſo, that moſt doe content themſelues with the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action of Gods worſhippe, neuer looking for ſoundneſſe of heart to come in faith, repentance, and obedience.</p>

So the Lord ſent his Prophet <hi>Mica,</hi> threatning them with iudgements, yet they were not reformed: and the reaſons is, becauſe they contented themſelues with theſe outward ſhewes of repentance, and thought their outward worſhippe was inough, and that God would bee content with their ſacrifices. And again, he heard the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> preach and denounce Gods Iudgements;<note place="margin">Ezec. 33.31.32.</note> yea, they commended him, and were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to heare him; yet this vile thought and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being in their hearts, that it was inough to heare, though they went no further, ſtopt their hearts ſo as they could not repent:<note place="margin">Mar. 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, in that the Lord compares their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and goodnes, all their piety and ſeruice of God to a <hi>Morning cloud,</hi> and to the dew before the Sunne, he ſhewes that their Repentance was not onely vnſound but alſo vncertaine, of no continuance; ſome good motions came into their minds, and ſome prickes of conſcience for their ſinnes; but yet they would not leaue their olde ſinnes, and turne to God with al their hearts.</p>

Yea, it is a righteous thing with God to giue ouer ſuch men and women vnto a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe, taking his ſpirit from them, ſo that they ſhal grow by degrees to be worſe and worſe, as wee may ſee in theſe Iewes, vnto whom the Lord had vſed many meanes to humble them, and to bring them home by repentance, as his Word in the mouthes of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, his bleſſings and benefites; beſides all this, his iudgements one vpon the necke of another; yet all would not ſerue to humble them; but all labour was loſt, and all coſt was ill beſtowed: Well, what was the end of all this, did they not grow to bee the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies to the Goſpell and Croſſe of Chriſt? And thus fared it with <hi>Iudas,</hi> being an Apoſtle, became a moſt deſperate reprobate. And thus doth Almighty God as a moſt iuſt reuenger of ſin, many times puniſh
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2570:110"/> one ſinne by another.

Oh then let vs looke to our owne ſoules, and try whether our repentance bee like to theirs or not, if wee find it vnſound, that it comes not to the heart, but reſts in outward ſhewes, and that it is ſoone vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; then truely it is nought, <hi>Dauid</hi> was humbled for his ſinnes all the dayes of his life: And it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Peter,</hi> that after his repentance,<note place="margin">Stella in Lucam.</note> hee roſe euer at the call of the Cocke to prayers, and other the like duties of piety and religion: And ſo muſt it bee with vs, otherwiſe God cares not for it, and it will ſtand vs in no ſtead in that day of Gods ſearching ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>Now, if wee may iudge of your Repentance by your life and outward behauiour, truely, it is to bee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">The great drought.</note> that it is little better then the repentance of this people, not worth a button, but counterfeit and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For, doth not the Lord euen call men to faſting, weeping, lamentation and mourning, to amendment of life and true repentance? and how do men performe this? who layes the iudgement of God to heart, who mournes for Gods anger vpon the land? nay rather, doe they not make this time of faſting, a time of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. Many ſeeme to repent, and to hang downe their heads like a bul-ruſh, and cry, Lord helpe vs,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2570:111"/> but truely it is but lippe-labour, but forged from the teeth outward; it comes not from the heart, but as this people in this place. Men are like to Schollers and Children, when the rodde is vpon their backe, they cry and yell, and promiſe to doe ſo no more; yet as ſoone as the rod is remoued, doe the ſame things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Euen ſo fareth it with moſt men amongſt vs, while the iudgements of God are vpon them, and their conſciences are vpon the racke, they are ready to cry to the Lord for helpe and deliuerance: but if the Lord doe but remoue his hand, you ſhall ſee them with the dogge to the vomite, and the Sow to the myre, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſtill, cruell ſtill, ignorant, filthy, and vncleane ſtill. Is not this the common repentance of our times? And is not this like the Iewes heere, which the Lord ſo highly condemneth? Oh alas, it is, and therefore the Lord muſt needs bee as highly offended with vs as euer hee was with them: And therefore it is now hie time to looke to our ſelues, to ioyne to our outward profeſſion, true reformation of heart and life, to build vpon the Rocke Chriſt; and for the time to come, to lay a ſure foundation, and be ſure of an honeſt heart, that it bee ſound in the worſhippe of God; for the Lord prefers ſuch a heart that comes in faith, repentance and obedience, before moſt glorious and goodly ſhewes, when ſincerity of heart is wanting. And truelie it is greatly to bee feared, that many now profeſſing the Goſpell in theſe dayes of peace, if the Sun ſhould wax hote, if ſtormes ſhould come, and tryall for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſake, they would fal away, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ee like this people heere; whoſe goodneſſe all they did profeſſe, was but as a droppe of dew before the Sunne. Oh then let vs labour for ſoundneſſe and ſincerity in Gods ſeruice: Let vs labour to find our eyes opened, our minds il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, our hearts ſoftned, and our affections tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

When <hi>Noah</hi> had preached repentance to the people of the old World, for the ſpace of one hundred and twenty yeares together, and the people had deſpiſed the ſame; what followed in the end, but a fearefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, euen a generall <hi>Deluge,</hi> which ſwept them all away?

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11.12</note> The Lord had often ſpoken to that people by his ſeruants, the Prophets, but they regarded them not; much like to our people in theſe times: but what followed? the Lord would neuer put vp this great ingratitude at their hands, but ſayth in the verſe following,<note place="margin">Ver. 12.1.1</note>

Let them ſtand neuer ſo much of their works of piety and deuotion, as Faſtings, prayer, almes, &amp;c. they are without the Word, but abhomination to the Lord, the Lord hates them, and his ſoule abhorres them, being not done in faith, repentance, and true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, euen his prayer ſhall be abhominable.</hi> But oh, the iuſt iudgement of God vpon them, they haue refuſed to embrace the loue of the truth, and haue beleeued lies, and therefore it is a righteous thing with God, to giue them ouer to hardneſſe of heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brobate minds to be deluded by Sathan, and ſo to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with him for euer.</p>

Wee ſee here, what a fearefull ſinne it is before the Lord to contemne his Word, to neglect his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and lightly to eſteeme of the meanes of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, it is of that nature that the Lord cannot at any hand put it vp, but will moſt ſurely puniſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt therof, as we haue ſeene before by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2570:116"/> of the old world, the Sodomites, the people of the Iewes and the like, And yet alas, wee ſee it a ſinne too too common, ſo as men doe generally neglect &amp; contemne, if not deſperately deſpiſe the means of their ſaluation, the moſt glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, making no account of it, but trample it vnder foot, &amp; eſteeme no more of the Word preached, then they do of their old ſhooes, they wil not go to the dore to heare it, but rather lye vpon their beds, ſit by the fire, talke in the ſtreetes, play in their bowling Allies, and to doe any baſe or vaine thing then to come into Gods houſe to heare his Word, whereby their poore ſoules might be ſaued. Oh horrible impietie! Well I remember that <hi>Saul</hi> obſerued <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeat when hee was wanting: much more doth the Lord take notice of our emptie ſeates and ſolitary Pewes when wee are wanting. Will you heare how the Lord hath grieuouſly puniſhed ſuch contempt, yea the neglect of holy meanes: and hath not the Lord met with vs for this ſinne? yes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe, as the plague and peſtilence is ſent for ſin, ſo I am perſwaded no one ſinne of the land hath been a greater cauſe to prouoke the Lord to anger, and to plague our land ſo often with the peſtilence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grieuous iudgements of vnſeaſonable weather, &amp; the like, then our long, our generall, and our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all contempt of his moſt holy Word, and prophaning of his Sabbaths: ſo as the Lord may ſay to vs, <hi>for this cauſe haue I cut you downe,</hi> euen by hundreds and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, for the contempt of the gracious means I haue vſed to do you good. Oh then I beſeech you in the feare of God, let vs lay this to heart: and ſeeing the Lord will neuer ſuffer the contempt of his Word goe vnpuniſhed: let vs now at laſt repent of this ſinne; let vs eſteeme better of the Word, let vs receiue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, and bee more carefull to heare it, otherwiſe
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2570:116"/> if wee liue in the open contempt of it, as now wee doe; I ſay vnto you in the name of the Lord, and from the warrant of his ſacred Word, by the which wee ſhall al bee iudged at the laſt day,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.21.</note> that it ſhall bee eaſier for the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomor</hi> then for vs: yea, the time may come when wee ſhall weepe and howle, crie out and ſay, Oh that I were a Sodomite, Oh that I had beene borne one of <hi>Gomorah,</hi> and enuy the felicity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the Sodomites in compariſon of our own tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, ſeeing the Word preached and taught is the ordinary meanes of our ſaluation, and the neglect and contempt thereof doth draw downe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> ſuch heauy iudgements vpon vs as we haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; how may this teach vs all according to godly <hi>Salomon</hi> his aduice, to <hi>take heed to our feet when we come into Gods houſe,</hi> and as our Sauiour ſayth,<note place="margin">Eccl. 4.17. Mat. 13. Luk. 8.18.</note> to <hi>take heed how wee heare?</hi> It is not to bee accounted a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we haue this liberty to come into Gods houſe, that wee may heare him ſpeake vnto vs in his Word: for if wee benefite not by theſe holy exerciſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and draw nearer vnto heauen, wee are made by them the more hardned in ſinne to our greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at the laſt: let vs not therefore come for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion ſake or for cuſtome, but for conſcience ſake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, &amp; in obedience to his commadement. And to this end wee muſt learne to prepare our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee come, by heartie prayer to God, both that he would direct the tongue of the Miniſter his ſeruant, that hee may deliuer the Word truely and powerfully, as alſo that hee would open our hearts as hee did the heart of <hi>Lydea,</hi> that wee may attend vnto thoſe things that ſhall bee taught; which godly preparation if it were carefully obſerued of our hearers, it could not bee after ſo much and long teaching, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2570:117"/> ſo ignorant and barren of Gods Worke, as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally they bee. Well, to conclude this Doctrine, let this be for our preſent inſtruction, that if we would bee free from the accuſation of wicked, graceles and prophane perſons; let vs labour to bee willing and well affected hearers, that wee come with hungring and thirſting deſires vnto the ſpirituall food of our ſoules, that it may bee vnto vs a ſauor of life vnto a better life: and that the Lord may neuer bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to vſe the ſame, as here hee did to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; namely, as an inſtrument to <hi>Cut downe,</hi> and a meanes of our further condemnation at the laſt; would wee not haue beene loath to haue beene in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when God rained downe fire and brimſtone from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon their heads? Oh Lord, how ſhould wee quake and tremble to thinke of this ſlaughter, that the Lord threatneth here, namely, <hi>To cut downe by his Prophets, and to ſlay by the words of his mouth.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt is, hee that outwardly in words profeſſeth the name of Chriſt, and yet in heart and life vtterly denies him, and theſe men are ſuch as come to church, heare the Word, receiue the Sacrament, and perform all outward actions of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, as if they were true Chriſtians: but if you looke into their liues, they are moſt vile and prophane.

                  <p>Firſt, the Atheiſt, who profeſſeth Chriſt in Word,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <note place="margin">Atheiſts.</note> and yet in heart contemnes him; theſe are they which for feare of the Law come to Church, heare the Word, and receiue the Sacrament; &amp; of this ſort are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſort of our Church-Papiſts, all contemners of the Word, and the like, profeſſing Chriſt in ſhew; but yet in heart they deny him, contemne him, make no account of God nor his Word, but tread it vnder foot.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe which for feare and faſhion ſake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> profeſſe Chriſt, come to Church, heare the Word,<note place="margin">Temporiſts.</note> &amp; receiue the Sacrament; yet all for faſhion and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, nothing for conſcience ſake: and of theſe wee haue thouſands amongſt vs, who performe all theſe duties for cuſtome and faſhion ſake. Oh let vs take heed, that we doe not profeſſe onely in outward ſhew; but looke to our hearts, that wee may doe all of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to pleaſe God, &amp; in obedience to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: let vs not make it a matter of cuſtome to come to heare the Word, to receiue the Sacrament, or for feare of the Law, but of conſcience towards God; otherwiſe theſe things will turne one day to our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condemnation.</p>
                  <p>And the third ſort are the Epicures which make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their pleaſures, ſports and paſtimes their God,<note place="margin">Epicures.</note> and will ſpend more houres in eating, drinking, ſports and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then in the ſeruice of God, then hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, praying, ſinging of Pſalmes and holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all their profeſſion of Chriſt is but in hypocriſie from the teeth outward, the heart is not ſound, theſe

Oh let ſuch men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bee heere admoniſhed, that it will not ſerue their turne, or goe for pay before God: Oh let vs learne then to goe farther, and in heart to beleeue in Chriſt, and in our liues to obey him: the people in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time ſay, <hi>Oh, wee will doe all;</hi> but what ſayth the Lord, <hi>Oh,</hi>

                  <p>And here the Lord compares theſe two together, and ſhewes that hee preferres faith, piety and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the heart; and mercifull and kind dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, before the great ſhewes which men make
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2570:143"/> in the outward ſeruice of God: True it is, the Lord will haue vs performe ſuch parts of his ſeruice &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as hee commandeth in his Word, and ſuch cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as hee preſcribes: but hee prefers faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, repentance, feare and loue of God, and loue &amp; kindneſſe, and mercifull dealing vnto men; before all ſuch ſacrifices and burnt offerings, and all other ſhewes whatſoeuer: Yea, all this outward ſhew, and all our profeſſion of Religion, if it bee not ioyned with the knowledge of God, that is, with faith, repentance, and obedience, and with the dueties of loue vnto men, it is but abhomination in the ſight of God.</p>

                  <p>This is the Doctrine: We ſee heere how the Lord doth farre preferre loue and kindneſſe to men, before al the outward ſhewes men make of religion whatſoeuer: nay, if men profeſſe neuer ſo much, make neuer ſo great a ſhew in the ſeruice of God, for their hearing, praying, receyuing, and the like; yet if they want loue &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their brethren, they cannot pleaſe God.

               <p>In the eight verſe, the Lord comes vnto them more particularly, and names <hi>Gilead,</hi> which was one of the Cities of refuge:<note place="margin">Ioſu. 20.8.9.</note> This City has inhabited of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and therefore ſhould haue been a mother City, a Nurſe to Religion and Piety.

               <p>In the ninth verſe, the Prophet doth not onely complaine of the common people, but ſhewes the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable impiety of the Prieſts, whom hee compares to Murderers and Robbers, becauſe they were full of cruelty and oppreſſion, couetous, and giuen to all manner of vile dealing,<note place="margin">The Prophet ſpares none.</note> but eſpecially they might bee compared to Robbers and Murderers, becauſe they did murder the poore ſoules of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                  <p>This was the very end of all thoſe Sacrifices that God appointed them to offer, not that they could pleaſe God of themſelues, but that they might be the meanes to bring them to true repentance: for when they ſhould ſee their beaſt ſlaine, and their bloud ſhed, it might admoniſh them of their bloudie ſinnes, and that they ſtood in need of the bloud of Chriſt for the pardon of them. This was the Lords <hi>Couenant,</hi> but they broke this, and euen in theſe ſacrifices, the which they ſo gloried in, <hi>Euen there haue yee trespaſſed againſt mee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, euen there they failed, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gods ordinances; and whereas they ſhould haue beene helps to haue led them to true repentance, and faith in Chriſt Ieſus, they now thought nothing leſſe then of repentance, and of Ieſus Chriſt, but perſwaded

Againe, the Lord teſtifieth in another place by the ſame Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Hee that killeth a Bullocke is as if hee ſlew a man: hee that ſacrificeth a ſheepe,

               <p>This City as wee may read, was one of the ſixe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of refuge, whither, if a man had ſlaine a man at vnawares,<note place="margin">Ioſu. 20.8.9</note> and as wee ſay, by chance medley, then he was to flie thither, and there the Prieſts and Leuites making inquiry of the fact, if they found that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Now this City,<note place="margin">What City Gilead was.</note> it was the place where the Prieſts and Leuites did dwell, which were ſet apart to teach the people, to inſtruct them, to offer ſacrifice for them, &amp; to pray for them; for they were to bee the light of the world: they muſt carry the <hi>

               <p>Well, ſeeing this is the righteous dealing of God <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> that thoſe places which hee hath moſt priuiledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, and beſtowed moſt meanes on aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they ſhall drinke deeper of the cup of his anger, if they bee wicked and vngodly, liuing in ſinne, then others that haue not enioyed the like fauours from God. Then it muſt teach vs all in the feare of God to looke about vs, that according to the meanes God doth beſtow vpon vs, wee labour to bee anſwerable to the ſame in fruites, in knowledge, in faith, in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and obedience, zeale, patience, &amp;c. But aboue all things take wee heed, that wee doe not degenerate and grow worſe then others to abound with iniquity, and impiety, with lying, deceit, ſwearing, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. For then let vs know that the Lord will make our puniſhment anſwerable to <hi>Tyrus</hi> &amp; <hi>Sydon,</hi> yea to <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomer;</hi> yea, their iudgements ſhall be ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ours, as our Sauiour ſayth:<note place="margin">Mat. 11.20.21 Ezech. 16.46.53.</note>

Oh then, if all things that are written, bee written for our learning, then let the iudgement of God vpon this City, bee a warning to vs all: Wee haue by Gods mercy the pure ſeruice and worſhip of God, his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſincerely preached, and taught amongſt vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt theſe threeſcore years together.

               <p>The Lord by his Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> hath threatned there a great and a grieuous iudgement againſt the neglect and contempt of his Word, and other the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meanes that hee doth vouchſafe vnto vs for our good: <hi>Behold, the dayes come, ſayth the Lord,</hi>

And in thoſe Epiſtles ſent to the ſeuen Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the Paſtor is commended for any vertue: ſo are the people, and when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor is reproued for any vice, the people alſo haue part in the ſame reproofe.

               <p>This is proued indeed by wofull experience in the World; Goe to any Towne or Parriſh in the land, where there liues a careleſſe and vnconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſter, an ignorant ſot, a beaſtly liuer, a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable worldly man, that ſeldome or neuer preacheth, and when hee doth, ſo colde and ſo raw, as good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whitte, as neuer the better: You ſhall finde generally ſinne to raigne in that place, the people like their Paſtor, blinde, ignorant, rude, ſo ſimple, and ſo ignorant in Gods matters, that they know nothing of the Scriptures, what Faith, Sacrament, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or New birth meanes; no, not the meaning of one Article of their Faith, or petition in the Lords prayer.</p>

               <p>Hence wee may learne, how apt wee bee by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> to ſucke in Popery and ſuperſtition: <hi>Iudah</hi> was pure,<note place="margin">Men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are apt to ſucke in Popery and ſuperſtition.</note> but ſo ſoone as the Lord brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they beganne to take grafts of their idolatrie, and to ioyne with them.</p>
               <p>So now, though wee are by Gods mercy freede from the filthineſſe of Popery and ſuperſtition; yet if the Lord ſhould returne it, and ſuffer it to bee
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2570:178"/> brought in againe amongſt vs, wee are by nature exceeding apt to receyue it, to take plants of it, and to loue and like it.</p>
               <p>This is clearly to bee ſeene in diuers places of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Iudg. 4.7.32. &amp; 4.1.2.</note> eſpecially by the example of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, in the Booke of Iudges: They committed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill againe and againe by Idolatry, they knew what that ſinne was; yea, they had experience of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity of Gods Iuſtice againſt it, and more ſtill they confeſſed it, and cryed for mercy: yet the ſame peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the children of the ſame people, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring their former fals, nor admoniſhed by Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer iudgements, fell a freſh into the ſame ſinne, and prouoked againe Gods wrath againſt them. Againe, <hi>Moſes</hi> laboured much vvith this people,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.3.</note> to peſwade them to make a Couenant with their God, and to cleaue to him in faithfull and conſtant obedience: Yet when they had beene but a while out of the way, they would needs haue a golden Calfe in ſtead of <hi>Moſes</hi> to goe before them: and therefore they came in all haſte to <hi>Aaron,</hi> vrging him to make them one: Which in carnall policy hee ſought to ſtay, calling for their golden Eare-rings, thinking indeed they would in no hand haue parted with them; But when it was to the erecting of Idolatry, he could no ſooner aske for them but he had them.</p>
               <p>This is clearely to bee ſeene by that of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea;</hi> where hee ſhewes how bountifull the people were in beſtowing their Corne and Wine,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.8.</note> and Oyle, together with their gold and ſiluer vpon <hi>Baal.</hi> They thought nothing good inough, that was giuen that way.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illany</hi> and <hi>Whoredome</hi> no better; and therfore howſoeuer the Papiſts ſtand vpon their good meaning, and their honeſt dealing; yet they worſhip the Deuil and not God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tels the Iſraelites, that they offered not to God as they intended, but vnto Deuils, euen the Idols of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Euen ſo the Papiſts though they brag of their good intents and meanings, the truth is, they offer not to God, but to the Deuill; neyther doe they worſhippe God, but the Deuill: and therefore wee muſt take heed, that wee neuer take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Popery, though the ſame ſeem neuer ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to fleſh and bloud. For all men are naturallie moſt inclinable vnto that which is euill: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt men being ſo prone vnto Popery, what can bee concluded but this, but that it is an euiil, and a damnable Religion?</p>
               <p>Oh then let vs labour to bee rooted and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the truth of God, to be builded vpon the rocke Ieſus Chriſt; that wee may neuer put out the hand to entertaine, or to receyue any dregges of Popery and Idolatry: but euen remember what Chriſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:<note place="margin">Reu. 18.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Come out of her my people, leaſt yee partake of her plagues.</hi> Oh, let vs euer ſtand out againſt their abhominable Idolatry, as no better then <hi>villany,</hi> and <hi>whoredome</hi> in Gods ſight.</p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:2570:179"/>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing wee are ſo apt by Nature,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> to receyue Idolatry, and Superſtition, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Poperie, it may bee a very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vnto vs, to prooue that all the Religion of the Papiſts is moſt wicked and abhominable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it agrees ſo fitte to the corrupt heart and Nature of man; for ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being corrupted, wee hate GOD, and hate his Truth.</p>
               <p>Now touching the Religion of the Papiſts, there is nothing in it, but that which Nature it ſelfe doth deſire: Let vs inſtant the ſame by one thing for all. What ſeemeth more againſt Nature practiſed by them, then their Whippings, and Scourgings, and that of themſelues; This wee may thinke to bee againſt Nature: But yet if wee examine the end of this puniſhment, as rhe ſame is inflicted vpon them, it will appeare otherwiſe, that Nature it ſelfe may in ſome ſort deſire the ſame: for that man that ſhall bee taught and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that when hee hath committed ſome great and grieuous ſinne as Adultery, Theft, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the like, that after ſuch a puniſhment inflicted once vpon him, his ſinne ſhall bee done away, and neuer after layde to his charge: Who would not vndergoe ſuch a puniſhment? better in reaſon vndergoe that for a time, then the guilt of an accuſing conſcience: For as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>A man may beare his ſickneſſe and infirmity, but a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conſcience who can beare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing that by Nature wee loue Popery and Idolatry, and that there is in the ſame nothing contrary to Nature, this proues that it is not the Religion of God, but the deuice of wicked men: for what can delight our corrupt nature more
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2570:180"/> then to ſee a Crucifixe, the picture of Chriſt on the Croſſe: To pray to Saints, Angels, the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. all this is very agreeable to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature of man, and therefore cannot bee good.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, wee may here behold the nature of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> ſinne, it is like the plague, eaſily conuayed from one to another,<note place="margin">Sinne is very fruitfull.</note> eaſily ſcattered and ſpread abroad, as wee ſee a naughty and a ſtinking Weede, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſpread, and will runne abroad, ſo will Idolatrie: and of all other ſinne, that is like vnto the Lappe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, it will runne as ſoone as it is hatcht; and as a man that liues in the houſe with them that haue the plague, is in exceeding danger to bee infected: ſo is it with them that liue in Idolatrous places, all to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they will bee infected.</p>
               <p>The Iſtaelites when they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Lord ſuffering a ſmall remnant of the Cananites to remaine ſtill in the land, for the tryall of the Iſraelites it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Pſa. 81.</note>
                  <hi>They were mingled amongſt them, and learned their works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the nature of ſinne to bee euer encroaching; giue it an ynch, and it will take an elle: It is like the Gangren or Canker, it fretteth, and eateth further and further as here, Idolatry was onely to bee found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not in <hi>Iudah;</hi> but it quickly ſet foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there, and ſpred it ſelfe in a ſhort time ouer all <hi>Iudah.</hi> Whereſoeuer it findeth entertainement, it enlargeth and ſpreadeth it ſelfe:<note place="margin">Pſal. 26.4.</note> Bidde ſinne home to thy houſe once, and like a bolde and ſhameleſſe Gueſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> it will come the ſecond time vninuited.</p>
               <p>How carefull then ought euery man to be, to ſhun and auoyd the company of Idolaters, and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked men?<note place="margin">Pro. 9.6.</note> It is the graue counſell of <hi>Salomon, Forſake the wicked, and you ſhall liue.</hi> Yea, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

               </p>
               <p>So then wee ſee how dangerous it is for men and women to bee preſent in places of Idolatry; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> to liue and conuerſe with Idolaters, it is very like they ſhal hardly eſcape from being tainted with Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For, herein the Papiſts haue the aduantage againſt vs: If they perſwade and intice, they haue our Nature to helpe them.

               <p>But Oh ſay ſome, this is too much niceneſſe,<label type="milestone">
